    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Short Answer</h2>

<p>Yes, sort of.</p>

<h2>Long Answer</h2>

<p>Inject-able mappings and context configuration are not offered, for obvious reasons. Otherwise in this version all other features are supported.</p>

<h2>A word about the future</h2>

<p>In future versions of Highway.Data, it is highly likely that features will be introduced that are not compatible with Database First.  How we handle this will be decided later, but this is not a feature which we are committed to fully supporting, it is provided as a <strong>basic</strong> scenario.</p>

<h3>Entity Framework Power Tools</h3>

<p>As a quick word, most people who have chosen Database First, did so because they believed that Code First would require that their classes create, or otherwise control their database.  This is not the case.  <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/72a60b14-1581-4b9b-89f2-846072eff19d">The Entity Framework team has for some time shipped a set of Power Tools</a> which allow the reverse engineering of existing database into Code First entities and mappings, which are then fully compatible with Highway.Data.  We encourage those currently using Database First to migrate using these tools to a Code First solution.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below is the current road map for the Highway Framework. All of these are subject to change, but we want to be as transparent as possible in planning so that we can gather input from the community. Any project not in the list is considered stable and not in need of changes in the next 6 months.</p>

    <id>http://hwyfwk.com/blog/2013/10/04/strong-names</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have today released an update to Highway.Pavement and Highway.Data which add strong name keys (SNKs) to the assemblies.  Furthermore, in keeping with good open source practices, the cryptographic keys to accomplish this signing are now checked into the source repository for each project.</p>
