    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below is the current road map for the Highway Framework. All of these are subject to change, but we want to be as transparent as possible in planning so that we can gather input from the community. Any project not in the list is considered stable and not in need of changes in the next 6 months.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-04T20:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://hwyfwk.com/blog/2013/10/04/strong-names</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have today released an update to Highway.Pavement and Highway.Data which add strong name keys (SNKs) to the assemblies.  Furthermore, in keeping with good open source practices, the cryptographic keys to accomplish this signing are now checked into the source repository for each project.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Thank you to friend of the project Michael Dudley for prompting us to do something which we should have done some time ago.</p>

<p>Please note, that since we&rsquo;ve introduced these keys, there is a chance some Binding Redirects in your config files may need to be updated.  Here is the public key information if you should need it:</p>

<p>```
Microsoft &reg; .NET Framework Strong Name Utility  Version 4.0.30319.17929
