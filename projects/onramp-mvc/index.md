# Description

Are you tired of setting up MVC websites, and repeating all the same structure and setup.  So were we, and that is where this OnRamp came from.  It brings together Castle.Windsor, WebActivator, NLog, and Highway.Data.  Our OnRamps are not binary packages, they bring content files into your solution, add other packages, but hide absolutely nothing.  They are all about Zero to Business Value in 30 seconds.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I get started?

[Right Here.](start.html)

## What about StructureMap, Ninject, Autofac, Log4Net, etcâ€¦

In our OnRamps, we are highly opinionated about our dependencies, selecting the projects we are comfortable with.  We have another project, [OnRamper] which is specifically designed to allow you to re-create an OnRamp of your own, which uses your preferred tools.
