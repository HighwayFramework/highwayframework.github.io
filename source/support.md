# Support Contracts

We recognize that some enterprises require that they secure support contracts for any open source libraries which are used within their development.  As such the core development team has reached an agreement with [Improving Enterprises](http://improvingenterprises.com/) to act as the primary purveyor of such contracts.  If you'd like to arrange for such support, please contact us via Team@HwyFwk.com .
