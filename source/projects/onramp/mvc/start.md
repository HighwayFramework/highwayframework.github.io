## Getting Started with Highway.OnRamp.MVC

### Create an MVC Site

Our first step will be to create an MVC site, or open an existing MVC project.

### Install the Package

Next open the **Package Manager Console** and issue the command:

```
Install-Package Highway.OnRamp.MVC.All
```

### Create Value, Not Boilerplate

That is all.  You should not be able to build and run your site, and a wide variety of features should be automatically engaged.  In the next section we'll introduce those features, one by one, and explain roughly how they work.
