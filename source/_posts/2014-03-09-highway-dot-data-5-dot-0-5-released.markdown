#Highway.Data 5.0.5 Released
## Better Documentation and Enhanced InMemoryDataContext
Thanks to Eric Burcham and Long Mai ( Two new contributors!!!! ) we have shipped a bug fix version that includes better API documentation and fixed several issues with the InMemoryDataContext.

### InMemoryDataContext
We now have a fix for both empty collection traversal and dependent entity duplication. If you had either of these issues good news!! If not, you now don't have to stay up late at night worrying if you will run into these issues. Sleep soundly and code well!
