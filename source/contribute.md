title: Our Mission

# Our mission is to be the most **useful**, **approachable**, **testable**, and **well documented** framework for .NET developers.

## Useful

First and foremost, anything we add to the Highway Framework should be useful, addressing a clear need for a significant portion of developers.

## Approachable

Our components should be approachable, not requiring a PhD in Computer Science to understand or implement.

## Testable

Our components will always be developed in such a way as to make testing them as easy as possible.  In most cases, this will be through providing interfaces, but in some cases this will be accomplished by providing specific unit testing shims.

## Well Documented

Our components will be documented, feature by feature, to explain how to use what has been developed.

# Pull Requests

We love our contributors, and we love GitHub.  If you'd like to help contribute to the Highway Framework, then we encourage you to fork one of our repositories, and with the above in mind, submit a pull request.
